# Changes in code.

1. Added git ignore
2. Added missing request package in package.json for the sender
3. Removed try catch in sender/index as now we dont need parsing
4. Tried gzip and brotli compression to minimize the number of bytes on the network

### Why I choose brotli compression?

I tried first using gzip as it is the old compression method that works without any dependency on the node version.

Then I tried brotli new compression method that needs node version 11 and above required, or need to install brotli package.

The data is clear after both compression Brotli offers a better compression ratio than gzip.
